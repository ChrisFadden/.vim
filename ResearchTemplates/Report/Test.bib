  abstract = {An adaptive method based on the idea of multiple component grids for the solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations using finite difference techniques is presented. Based upon Richardson-type estimates of the truncation error, refined grids are created or existing ones removed to attain a given accuracy for a minimum amount of work. The approach is recursive in that fine grids can contain even finer grids. The grids with finer mesh width in space also have a smaller mesh width in time, making this a mesh refinement algorithm in time and space. We present the algorithm, error estimation procedure, and the data structures, and conclude with numerical examples in one and two space dimensions.},

  doi = {10.1109/JSTSP.2013.2257679},
  abstract = {The differential geometry of array manifold curves has been investigated extensively in the literature, leading to numerous applications. However, the existing differential geometric framework restricts the Cartan matrix to be purely real and so the vectors of the moving frame BBU(s) are found to be orthogonal only in the wide sense (i.e. only the real part of their inner product is equal to zero). Imaginary components are then accounted for separately using the concept of the inclination angle of the manifold. The purpose of this paper is therefore to present an alternative theoretical framework which allows the manifold curve in FrakturCN to be characterized in a more convenient and direct manner. A continuously differentiable strictly orthonormal basis is established and forms a platform for deriving a generalized complex Cartan matrix with similar properties to those established under the previous framework. Concepts such as the radius of circular approximation, the manifold curve radii vector and the frame matrix are also revisited and rederived under this new framework.},

  abstract = {A backscatter-based microwave imaging technique that compensates for frequency-dependent propagation effects is proposed for detecting early-stage breast cancer. An array of antennas is located near the surface of the breast and an ultrawideband pulse is transmitted sequentially from each antenna. The received backscattered signals are passed through a space-time beamformer that is designed to image backscattered signal energy as a function of location. As a consequence of the significant dielectric-properties contrast between normal and malignant tissue, locations corresponding to malignant tumors are associated with large energy levels in the image. The effectiveness of these algorithms is demonstrated using simulated backscattered signals obtained from an anatomically realistic MRI-derived computational electromagnetic breast model. Very small (2 mm) malignant tumors embedded within the complex fibroglandular structure of the breast are easily detected above the background clutter.},

One-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) examples of soft source generation and a 2-D scattering study of a dielectric cylinder are given.},

  abstract = {Discover New Methods for Dealing with High-Dimensional Data  A sparse statistical model has only a small number of nonzero parameters or weights; therefore, it is much easier to estimate and interpret than a dense model. Statistical Learning with Sparsity: The Lasso and Generalizations presents methods that exploit sparsity to help recover the underlying signal in a set of data.  Top experts in this rapidly evolving field, the authors describe the lasso for linear regression and a simple coordinate descent algorithm for its computation. They discuss the application of $\mathscr{l}$1 penalties to generalized linear models and support vector machines, cover generalized penalties such as the elastic net and group lasso, and review numerical methods for optimization. They also present statistical inference methods for fitted (lasso) models, including the bootstrap, Bayesian methods, and recently developed approaches. In addition, the book examines matrix decomposition, sparse multivariate analysis, graphical models, and compressed sensing. It concludes with a survey of theoretical results for the lasso.  In this age of big data, the number of features measured on a person or object can be large and might be larger than the number of observations. This book shows how the sparsity assumption allows us to tackle these problems and extract useful and reproducible patterns from big datasets. Data analysts, computer scientists, and theorists will appreciate this thorough and up-to-date treatment of sparse statistical modeling.},
