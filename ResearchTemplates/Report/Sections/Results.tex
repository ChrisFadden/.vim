\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
The Scattering matrix for a structure provides useful information relating 
incident and transmitted waves.  The reflection coefficient, $\Gamma$, is equal 
to $S_{11}$.  The reflected power, R, of a material is $ |\Gamma|^2$.  The 
transmission coefficient $\tau$ is equal to $S_{21}$, with the transmitted 
power, T, equal to (1 - R) in a lossless material.  These parameters are 
essential to an analysis of waveguides, and other structures of interest to high 
frequency engineers.  In order to test the code, a test case was constructed, 
involving a structure with four regions, including the reflection and 
transmission regions, with both a dielectric and a magnetic material.  The 
reflected and transmitted power coefficients were used to benchmark the Python 
code based on this derivation.  The coefficients were in agreement, indicating 
an accurate code.
