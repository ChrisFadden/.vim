This paper focuses on the Scatter Matrix Method, a variant of the Transfer 
Matrix Method, to numerically solve electromagnetic problems.  Starting from the
partial differential equation form of Maxwellâ€™s Equations, a matrix form of 
these equations is derived.  The matrix equation is solved using eigenvalues and 
eigenvectors.  The eigensolutions are used to create a scattering matrix for a 
single layer of a material.  The global scattering matrix for a general layered 
material is made by combining the individual scattering matrices using the 
Redheffer Star Product.  From the global scattering matrix, the reflectance and
transmittance can be derived.  The results of the numerical simulation have 
minimal error when compared to published results.
